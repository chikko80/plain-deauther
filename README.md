# plain-deauther
This is a plain wifi deauther written in python based on aircrack-ng.

A desktop and scaled-down mobile version is provided.

I developed that for my personal use only!

I developed it mainly for an easy use mobile command line tool!

I developed it for my special usecase and adapted the program for my devices!

I cannot guarantee that its running flawless on your devices!

This can vary a lot on mobile devices depending on the kernel etc.
